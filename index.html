                <p>
                    I know the pieces fit
                    'Cause I watched them fall away
                    Mildewed and smouldering
                    Fundamental differing
                    Pure intention juxtaposed
                    Will set two lovers' souls in motion
                    Disintegrating as it goes
                    Testing our communication
                    The light that fueled our fire then
                    Has burned a hole between us so
                    We cannot seem to reach an end
                    Crippling our communication
                    I know the pieces fit
                    'Cause I watched them tumble down
                    No fault, none to blame
                    It doesn't mean I don't desire
                    To point the finger, blame the other
                    Watch the temple topple over
                    To bring the pieces back together
                    Rediscover communication
                    The poetry
                    That comes from the squaring off between
                    And the circling is worth it
                    Finding beauty in the dissonance
                    There was a time that the pieces fit
                    But I watched them fall away
                    Mildewed and smouldering
                    Strangled by our coveting
                    I've done the math enough to know
                    The dangers of our second guessing
                    Doomed to crumble unless we grow
                    And strengthen our communication
                    Cold silence has
                    A tendency to
                    Atrophy any
                    Sense of compassion
                    Between supposed brothers
                    Between supposed lovers
                </p>
